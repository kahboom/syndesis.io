== syndesis crc

With `syndesis crc` you can adequately manage a https://code-ready.github.io/crc/[CodeReady Containers] installation for hosting Syndesis.
This command is especially useful for a simple and self-contained development workflow.

`syndesis crc` requires that you have a current crc binary in your path.
You can download it directly from https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned[https://cloud.redhat.com].

`syndesis crc` will attempt to download the latest syndesis cli from the https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis/releases/latest[syndesis release page]. If this fails, you can try downloading the right binary for your distribution and placing it under `tools/bin/commands/binaries`.

                              By default, install into the current project (without deleting)
    --reset                   Reset and initialize the CodeReady Containers installation by
                              'crc delete && crc start'.
    --full-reset              Full reset and initialie by

=== Installing Syndesis

You can easily install Syndesis with the option `--install`.
This option triggers the creation of all relevant OpenShift resources objects in the currently connected OpenShift project.

If you want to use a different project, then use `--project` (short: `-p`) to specify this project.

WARNING: Any existing project will be deleted first when specified with `--project`. This option is also an easy and quick way to recreate a Syndesis installation.

=== Resetting CodeReady Containers

The quickest way to get a fresh Syndesis setup is to use `--project` which will install Syndesis into a clean, new project.

However, you can also recreate the whole CodeReady Containers installation with `--reset`. This will delete the CodeReady Containers VM (`crc delete`) and create a new one (`crc start`).
It doesn't harm if the CodeReady Containers VM does not exist so that you can use `--reset` also on a fresh CodeReady Containers installation.

If you want to get a real clean installation use `--full-reset` which deletes the `~/.crc` directory which holds downloaded artifacts like the ISO image for the CodeReady Containers VM.
Using `--full-reset` forces CodeReady Containers to re-download all those files.

There are several options which influence the re-creation of the VM:

[cols="5,10,2",options="header"]
|===
| Option
| Description
| Default

|`--memory`
| Memory to use for the CodeReady Containers VM.
| 8 GB

|`--cpus`
| Number of CPUs used for the CodeReady Containers VM.
| 4

|`--pull-secret-file`
| File holding the OCP4 pull secret
| -

|`--vm-driver`
| Which virtual machine driver to use. For OS X this can be 'virtualbox'.
| -

|`--bundle`
| Path to system bundle (required when using virtualbox vm-driver)
| -

|===

=== Example

This short example performs the following actions:

* Stops and deletes a running CodeReady Containers VM (if existent)
* Removes `~/.crc` (if existent)
* Install Syndesis in OpenShift modes (S2I builds & image streams) in project `syndesis`
* Open Syndesis UI in the default browser

```
# Complete fresh installation in project "syndesis"
syndesis crc --full-reset --install --project syndesis

# Open Syndesis in default browser
syndesis crc -o
```
