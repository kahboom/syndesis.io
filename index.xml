      <description>Buildtool &amp;ldquo;syndesis&amp;rdquo; Syndesis uses a single tool for controlling various aspects of the build and developer related tasks. This script can be found in $SYNDESIS_DIR/tools/bin and is called syndesis. It requires bash and can be used on any Unix or macOS.
To have this script handy all the time it is recommended to either put this bin/ directory into the path or add a symlink from syndesis into a directory which is already on your execution path.</description>

      <description>Heads up! This is a work in progress... and may always be... Please check back regularly.  The Syndesis maintainers are always looking for the optimum way to develop Syndesis. We aim to have a development process that enables fast delivery across all features and components, taking into account priorities from the community. Speed of development has to be balanced against total community ownership, knowledge sharing, and stability of the software.</description>

      <description>There are many ways to contribute to Syndesis. All contributions are valued and welcomed, be it fixing a typo in documentation, raising an issue to report a bug, or creating a whole new awesome feature. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if this is your first contribution to an open source project: the Syndesis maintainers can help you if you need it.
Improving documentation Documentation is in various places in our repositories. We are committed to streamlining this, but for now there are a few different places to look.</description>

      <description>You can try out Syndesis very easily locally, too. All you need is a Minishift installation which is available for all the major operating systems (Linux, OS X and Windows). The following examples assume that you have Minishift installed and can be called with minishift from the command line. So, minishift is supposed to be available in your search path, i.e. located in a directory contained in your $PATH environment variable (Linux, macOS) or in a directory from your system path (Windows).</description>

      <description>This document want to illustrates at high level some of the components that makes up Syndesis and how they are communicating together to finally serves the creation of an integration. We are using Apache Camel as a runtime target, though it would be possible to extend the project and makes it suitable to any other integration platform.

      <description>Any integration you need to create typically starts and ends to a data source. Thanks to Syndesis you will be able to discover automatically any of those data sources and make easier the configuration of connection for the citizen integrator. Any connector can provide the &amp;ldquo;Connection Autodiscovery&amp;rdquo; feature by making a little extra development and using any kind of service registry you have at your disposal.
JSON Descriptor The first thing we need to do is to configure the json connector configuration.</description>

      <description>As we&amp;rsquo;ve already seen in the Connector Development guidelines, the connection to or from a generic data source is proxied by the presence of the Connector Proxy component. In this page you will find how to configure it in all its details. The descriptor does a fundamental job in linking together the GUI (who will use the configuration to dynamically define the connector behavior), the server, the meta (which can be required to serve certain meta information dynamically) and finally the integration platform runtime where the application will run (being Apache Camel the one we use as reference).</description>

      <description>A very important feature of any integration platform is to manage transparently the data format between the source and the destination channel. Syndesis and the powerful visual data mapper tool bundled with it, simplifies this concept with the definition of a datashape.
A datashape is a way to describe any inbound/outbound message format and to allow the user to easily map each data property in the integration step: said in other words, you will be able to transform on the fly the input/output of the data involved in an integration.</description>

      <description>If you’d like to get a local development environment up and running, for both the UI and REST API, this is how you’d do it.
Tips
 Build on branch, not master. Callback URL Example: https://syndesis.192.168.64.29.nip.io/api/v1/credentials/callback  Requirements You can follow these steps if it’s your first time setting up Syndesis, or if you want a fresh local installation to replace an existing one. Some environment-specific instructions may be available below as well.</description>

      <description>If Syndesis does not provide a connector for the application or service that you want to connect to in an integration, an experienced developer can develop and contribute a new Syndesis connector.
This documentation provides details about developing, testing, and deploying a new Syndesis connector. It uses the example of creating the MongoDB connector to illustrate internal behavior and analyze development choices.
Before you start to develop a connector, you should:</description>

In details Syndesis consists of the following groups:

      <description>One of the most important reason why we are developing an IPAAS is to make citizen integrators life simpler. This persona must be able to quickly create integrations by composing heterogeneous sources of data. One of the typical gap that she finds is to be aware of which are those sources available. The expected scenario is to know before-hand the host names of databases, queues, REST endpoints&amp;hellip;

      <description>MongoDB connector was first introduced in Syndesis 1.8 as tech preview feature. We&amp;rsquo;ve worked hard during the development of version 1.9 and have it now as a general available feature!
Document-oriented databases have become extremely popular in the last years becoming one of the most important NO SQL choice out there. Without any doubt, MongoDB is the most prominent solution in this space. The easiest way to learn about this connector is to play around with the MongoDB Quickstart.</description>

      <description>Syndesis is an open Source Integration Platform As A Service (IPaaS), on premise or in the cloud, with no coding required. A business analyst can set up their own Twitter to Salesforce campaign and deploy the integration in a container on OpenShift.
The easiest way to try Syndesis is to use a trial of the product called Fuse Online. You can sign up at https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/fuse-online, and skip right to the QuickStart section.</description>

      <description>The Integration Platform That’s For Everyone - No Coding Required. Best of All? Syndesis runs in the cloud or on-premise, on OpenShift or Kubernetes. The week before Red Hat Summit is always crazy, seemingly endless demo recordings, and lots of blood, sweat, and tears. So many tears. Even more so when your project is going to have it&amp;rsquo;s first public airing. And so our team is ecstatic to announce the release of Syndesis, a game-changing data integration platform that can be run in the cloud, requires no code whatsoever (but can be extended, should you be so inclined), and, in typical Red Hat fashion, is completely open source.</description>

      <description>Syndesis looks awesome. Who is it for? Anyone that wants to integrate services. Syndesis includes a swish UI that enables the user to design integration flows and manage them from their browser.
No coding required&amp;hellip; Unless you really want to and then Syndesis allows you to dive into the code, develop your own connectors (if one doesn&amp;rsquo;t already exist), or hack on the integration definition directly.

      <description>Syndesis is a flexible platform that provides core integration capabilities as a service. It can be run on the cloud or on premises with OpenShift or Kubernetes. It is fully extensible and, best of all, it is free and open source software.
Open source IPAAS Gartner defines an Integration Platform As A Service as is a suite of cloud services enabling development, execution and governance of integration flows connecting any combination of on premises and cloud-based processes, services, applications and data within individual or across multiple organizations.</description>
